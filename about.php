          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>Built in 1951 by Sir Michael and Lady Susan Wood, founder of the Flying Doctor Service, it began as a dairy farm.</p>
		  <p>St Julian's Centre was bought in 1979 by the ACK from Community of Sisters of St. Julian's of England after they decided to return to their country. Since then the Centre has been used by the Church as a training facility.</p>
		  <p>The Centre is now open to church institutions and Church related organizations to hold seminars and courses. It is also a place of rest and recreation for individuals and families.</p>

          <h2>Vision and Mission Statement</h2>
          <p>To provide a place of life for Christians from all walks, a place for rest and recreation and holding seminars and courses relating to the development of their work.</p>
		  <p>To make the facility cost effective and thus render it an asset rather than a liability to ACK.</p>
		  <p>The Centre will assist in the propagation of the gospel by contributing towards the budget of the Province.</p>
